Read All Files from a source Location and print to a text file. Some functionality is not currently in the project. More to come!

- Mainly used for listing all media in a directory and all subdirectories.
- Probably won't work for most kinds of directories for the time being.
- Not heavily tested in most situations yet, It will break easy.
- Needs alot of refactoring, moving things into different files, removing old variables and renaming.
- Will go through and clean up some code.
- Will go through and comment.
